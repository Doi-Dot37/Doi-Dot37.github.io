                      <h3 id="Episodes">The Episodes</h3>

                      <p class="Border"><br>In episode 1a, "Take the Plunge", the season takes place in the land of "Goiky" and started because everyone wanted "Dream Island" because the Annoucer had them compete for it. The Annoucer then held a contest on who could stay on a balence beam the longest to determine teams.<br></p> <p class="Border"><br>In episode 1b, "Take the Plunge Part 2", The team names decided were the 'Squashy Grapes' and the 'Squishy Cherries'. Another challenge was given too, to travel and set sail across the 'Goiky Canal' and reach the finish line by crafting a boat. The team who won was the Squishy Cherries due to the Squashy Grape's motor boat crashing into the other team's boat, and flying over the finish line.<br></p>  <p class="Border"><br>In episode 2, "Barriers and Pitfalls" the elimination system was called, "View Voting", this means the people watching get to vote on who is eliminated, that being Flower. Also, win tokens are introduced! A win token halfs the amount of votes you receive by viewers. In the previous challenge, Pin was first to cross the finish line and therefore gets a token. Moving on, the challenge in this episode was to pass a tricky obstacle course and fill your teams tank with water at the end of the course. The team who won was the Squashy Grapes and Needle wins a win token for finishing the entire course first.<br></p>  <p class="Border"><br>In episode 3, "Are you Smarter than a Snowball", is Spongy eliminated and the contestants' challenge was to take a test but majority of the contestants fail to even answer.

                       <p class="Border"><br>In episode 5, "Bridge Crossing", Woody gets eliminated. The contestants are told to cross a bridge, but no one is able to cross. A tiebreaker is held and once again the Squishy Cherries lose.<br></p>  <p class="Border"><br>In episode 6, "The Power of Three", Pin is eliminated because she didn't use her win token to half the amount of votes she got. Each team is told to cross a beam on 1 island, find a raft inside the safes on that island to get to Island 2, and make stacks of blocks to search through the keys hanging at the top in order to open the door of a building on Island 3. The contestants who got a win token were Pen, Eraser, and Firey and the Squashy Grapes lost.<br></p>  <p class="Border"><br> In episode 7, "Puzzling Mysteries", Needle is eliminated even with her win token and the teams are told to solve a puzzle of their logos. The Squishy Cherries struggled to solve the puzzle meanwhile the Squashy Grapes easily win. As a reward, they got to take a contestant from the opposite team, they choose Firey.<br></p>  <p class="Border"><br>In episode 8, "Cycle of Life", there is no elimination and the challenge was a relay race. However, the object they had to carry was one of your own teammates. The Squashy Grapes win and the Annoucer offers to bring back a previously eliminated contestant.<br></p>  <p class="Border"><br> In episode 9, "Insectophobes Nightmare", Blocky rejoins and is now on the Squashy Grapes. As a result, the Squashy Grapes were split and formed two new ones, the "Squashy Grapes" and team "Another Name". There was now 3 teams and now whoever is in the bottom 2 of each eliminations, the winning team determines who to take on their team and who to eliminate. The challenge was a six-legged-race and the determined winner was team Squishy Cherries and the Squashy Grapes lost because they came last.<br></p>  <p class="Border"><br> In episode 10, "Crybaby!", Teardrop gets out and Snowball joins the Squishy Cherries. Each team is in a water tank and is told to fill up their tanks with water. However, a tiebreaker was needed and it was a skiing contest. The Squashy Grapes placed second and are safe but because of an accident, another tiebreaker was needed. This time the tiebreaker was a handstand contest in which the Squishy Grapes win and at the end of the episode, Eraser wins a win token. <br></p>  <p class="Border"><br>In episode 11, "Lofty", Golfball gets eliminated even with her win token, meanwhile, Rocky joins the Squishy Cherries. The challenge in this episode was an aerial contest where all the contestants are tied to a balloon high up in the air. Their objective was the pop the opposite team's balloons first. The Squashy Grapes win and Another Name loses.<br></p>  <p class="Border"><br>In episode 12, "A Leg Up in the Race", Coiny is eliminated and the teams have been broken up. Everyone competes for themsleves and the contest was the climb ladders. Afterwards, the Annoucer introduced a new point system and rewarded everyone 30 points to start and anyone who had win tokens would get a bonus of additonal points. He also removes points for the amount of votes anyone has ever received. Tennis Ball, Snowball, Bubble, and Rocky are all up for elimination.<br></p>  <p class="Border"><br>In episode 13, "Don't Lose Your Marbles", Snowball is eliminated and the challenge is to find a red ball that is located in random spots. If you find a red ball, you gain points depending what time you gave it in, however if you turn in something that's not a red ball, you lose points. Match, Ice Cube, Rocky, and Tennis Ball had the fewest points and are up for elimination.<br></p>  <p class="Border"><br>In episode 14, "Half a Loaf is Better than None", Match is eliminated and the Annoucer created a comeback competiton between all the previously eliminated contestants.

Each contestant chooses their choice of contest and the players who with the least amount of points would be up for elimination, that being Bubble, Pen, and Rocky.<br></p> <p class="Border"><br>In episode 16, "Bowling, Now with Explosions", Pen is eliminated and the contest is a bowling competiton, however, because of the fact the characters were objects, it's common for some characters to not have arms, and so the challenge could only be partaken by those with arms. Firey, Leafy, Blocky, Bubble, and Pencil were the only one's left with arms. In the challenge, Firey excelled the best and everyone but him was up for elimination.<br></p>
 <p class="Border"><br>In Episode, 17, "The Reveal", Block is eliminated and the challenge was a frisbe contest. In this contest, contestants were told to pair up for the sake of the challenge. After the contest was over, each pair was given a reward based on their performance in the contest. Ice Cube and Leaf receive a -1000 points reward and therefore, are up for elimination. But, the viewers would not vote on who to eliminate, they would vote for a "Reccomended Character" to join the game. Reccomended characters are characters that were created by viewers and submitted to JacknJellify to be featured in an episode.<br></p>

                       <h3 id="Episodes2">The Episodes (Again)</h3>

                      <p class="Border"><br> In episode 18, "Reveak Novum", Tennis Ball is eliminated and the character that entered the competion to join the game was David. The challenge was a simple staring contest in a boxing arena. Pencil won but however because of what the Annoucer described as "budget cuts" her points first two digits were only counted and she along with Firey, and Spongy are up for elimination. In this episode too, previously eliminated contestants are shown to be trying to escape the "TLC" AKA the "Tiny Loser Chamber". The TLC is where the eliminated contestants have been staying cramped in for 18 months.<br.</p>
                      <p class="Border"><br>In episode 19, "Recission", Pencil is eliminated and points were officially removed. The challenge is a unicycle race in which Bubble easily beats everyone in. The Annoucer states Bubble could choose any other contestant who didn't finish of her choice to be safe alongside her from elimination. Bubble was orginally going to choose Ice Cube due to their close aliance, however, Ice Cube stated she was no longer alligned her and so Bubble safes Leafy. Rocky, David, Spongy, Firey, and Ice Cube are up for elimination.<br></p>
                        <p class="Border"><br>In episode 20, "Gardening Hero", David is eliminated and the challenge this time takes place in Space due to "Budget Cuts". The Annoucer then states everyone has immunity but if you die in space, you lose it and you're up for elimination. Only Bubble suceeds and is allowed to give someone immunity again and so she chooses Leafy yet again. Firey, Spongy, Ice Cube, and Rocky are up for elimination. But before the episode ended, it was annouced there would be one more rejoin for a previously eliminated contestant to come back.<br></p>

                      <p class="Border"><br>In episode 21, "The Glistening", Ice Cube was eliminated and Flower rejoins the game. The challenge was simple, jump the futherest and you get immunity. Leafy found a map that teleported her to a land called, "YoyleLand" and so she won the challenge, however, she felt bad for Spongy because she had technically killed him in the previous challenge and so she gave him immunity. So, Leafy, Firey, Rocky, and Bubble are up for elimination.<br></p>
                      
                      <p class="Border"><br>In episode 22, "Don't Pierce my Flesh", Rocky is eliminated and the challenge was a race to escape a volcano first. Unfortunately, the volcano was erupting and everyone was burned by the lava and that meant the Annoucer too. The contest needed subsitutes in place of the Annoucer and because only Flower and Firey escaped, they created, "Flower Speaker Box" and "Firey Speaker Box" who were both completely biased to their creators and gave them immunity meanwhile everyone else was up for elimination.<br></p>
                      <p class="Border"><br>In episode 23, "Hurtful", Flower accidentally kills her own speaker box and so the only host remaining was Firey Speaker Box. Eventually, the Annoucer is recovered and comes back to eliminate Spongy, who got the most votes. The challenge was a throwback to all the other previous challenges, the goal was to be the first to complete everything first. During the volcano course, Flower was in the lead but the others quickly catched up and because of an argument between Flower and Leafy, Bubble was able to quickly kill Flower and steal immunity into the final 3.<br></p>
                
                       <p class="Border"><br>In episode 24, Flower was eliminated but however, this episode was a filler episode because of "budget cuts" and therefore, the Annoucer had to cancel BFDI. To fill in the episode, Flower ended up throwing bug eggs at him and so chaos strucked. At the end of the episode, Flower gets sent to the TLC and Bubble, Firey, and Leafy end up all getting their own recovery center so incase they die, they'd be immediately back.<br></p>
                       <p class="Border"><br>In episode 25, "Return of the Glider Hanger", the viewers voted on who deserved Dream Island and in 3rd place was Bubble, it was between Leafy and Firey and Firey won dream island! He decided to let everyone in, besides Leafy however because in previous episodes, he made a ferris wheel for him and her but it only worked for him because at some point in the wheel it'd drop lava, which is like water to Firey but to Leafy it killed her and so he mistakened Leafy's death and obvious dislike to his gift as rude and mean, therefore he didn't let Leafy in. In a fit, Leafy decided to forge a fake check and called the Annocer to buy Dream Island. Everyone finds out and they chased after Leafy and caught her, destroying her recovery center along with the others because of Flower's rage, to excute Leafy. However, using a glider, Firey swiftly saves Leafy because he realized Dream Island did not matter more than his friendship between him and Leafy.<br></p>
